    <string name="aboutApp">
        -> This application was made by UC Irvine students for the course CS 125 - Next Gen Search Systems.
        \n-> This app uses micro-reports generated by users to store into a Firebase database for later queries by users.
        \n-> Made in Winter 2018

        -> Accounting for which floor the restroom is on
        \n-> Update ALL graphics for consistency
        \n-> Auto-refreshing the map when the user submits a report so that it will show the new restroom
        \n—> (App refreshes the map after every minute.) So it kinda does this
        \n-> If the restroom location is in some distance away from another zipcode, add it to that zipcode group.

    <string name="changelog">
        -> V 1.09 (Current):
        \n—> Has default static filter of 1000 meters for the restrooms.
        \n——> Planning on letting users modify this filter value.

        \n\n-> V 1.08:
        \n—> When submitting a restroom, it will check nearby locations to see if it falls into another zipcode.
        \n——> If it does then it adds the restroom to that zipcode\'s table.
        \n——> This allows for redundant data, but the margin is small enough that it really only covers boundary restrooms.
        \n—> Does the same for filing complaints.

        \n\n-> V 1.07:
        \n—> Moved toast message to be at the top of the screen to avoid cluttering the bottom.
        \n—> Changed text for filters button to try and make it more clear for the functionality of the buttons.
        \n—> Changed colors from orange to blue.
        \n—> Updated some graphics.
        \n—> Fixed an issue where the app will try to query the DB w/o actually knowing the zipcode.

        \n\n-> V 1.06:
        \n—> Added new activity that allows the user to drag and drop the restroom location for increased accuracy.
        \n—> If the new report has an \"N\A\", it will use the previous report\'s feature instead.

        \n\n-> V 1.05:
        \n—> Release to Production.
        \n—> App refreshes the map after every minute.
        \n——> Unless the user is interacting with it at least once every 30 seconds.
        \n—> Prevent (starting a report)/(filing a complaint) if the app can\'t access the user\'s location.
        \n—> Toast Activity Gates to help users understand what is happening.

        \n\n-> V 1.04: (Beta)
        \n—> Prevented trying to use the database if the database wasn\'t responsive
        \n——> Prevents crashes when the DB isn\'t ready yet
        \n—> On App resume it reloads the user\s location and the restrooms

        \n\n-> V 1.03: (Beta)
        \n—> In theory fixed an issue if the app somehow couldn\'t get the user\'s location it crashed.
        \n—> Finished implementing all the filters. (Amenities and Open or not)
        \n—> App tells the user how many restrooms it found.
        \n—> Filters are saved between activities.
        \n——> NOTE: filters are cleared when the application is closed.
        \n—> Changed the Radio Groups to be vertical to allow for more space for the text.
        \n—> Updated graphics to be more consistent.

        \n\n-> V 1.02: (Beta)
        \n—> Added feature to restrooms: Last Updated feature.

        \n\n-> V 1.01: (Beta)
        \n—> Beta Testing.
